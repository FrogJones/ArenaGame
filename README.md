## ‚ú® Features

### üé® Authentic PS1 Visuals
- **Pixelated Textures**: Nearest-neighbor filtering for that classic blocky look
- **Low-Poly Models**: Minimalist geometry true to PS1 limitations
- **Distance Fog**: Atmospheric fog effect for authentic depth limitation
- **Retro Color Palette**: Carefully chosen colors that evoke 90s gaming nostalgia

### üí° Dynamic Lighting System
- **Multiple Point Lights**: Realistic torch illumination throughout the level
- **Flickering Effects**: Dynamic torch flames with subtle intensity variations
- **Minimal Fill Light**: Subtle directional lighting to maintain visibility

### üéµ Immersive Audio Experience
- **Positional Footsteps**: Audio triggers only during movement with realistic timing
- **Randomized Sound Effects**: Multiple footstep samples prevent repetitive audio
- **Spatial Audio**: 3D positioned audio using OpenAL for realistic sound placement
- **Ambient Soundscape**: Atmospheric audio layers for enhanced immersion

### üéÆ Intuitive Controls
- **Free-Look Camera**: Smooth mouse-controlled camera with configurable sensitivity
- **WASD Movement**: Standard FPS-style movement with momentum
- **Camera Bobble**: Subtle walking animation for authentic feel
- **Boundary Detection**: Smart collision system keeps camera within level bounds

## üî¨ Technical Implementation

### Rendering Pipeline

![Rendering Pipeline](docs/images/rendering-pipeline.png)
*OpenGL rendering pipeline flow*

The rendering system implements several key PS1-era techniques:

- **Limited Color Depth**: Reduces color precision to match original hardware limitations
- **Fog Implementation**: Distance-based fog using OpenGL's built-in fog functions
- **More Planned**

### Audio System Architecture

The audio implementation focuses on performance and authenticity:

- **Streaming Audio**: Efficient WAV file streaming via libsndfile
- **3D Positional Audio**: OpenAL-based spatial audio for realistic sound placement
- **Dynamic Loading**: On-demand audio resource management
- **Low Latency Playback**: Optimized for responsive footstep audio triggering

## üõ£Ô∏è Development Roadmap

### üéØ Short Term Goals
- [ ] **Vertex Precision Reduction**: Simulates PS1's limited vertex precision for authentic jitter
- [ ] **Affine Texture Mapping**: Recreates the characteristic texture warping of PS1 graphics
- [ ] **Enhanced Menu System**: Pause menu with graphics and audio settings
- [ ] **Multiple Level Support**: Level selection and seamless transitions
- [ ] **Improved Camera Bobble**: More realistic walking animation synchronization
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Frame rate improvements and memory usage reduction
- [ ] **Configuration System**: User preferences saving and loading

### üöÄ Long Term Vision
- [ ] **Particle Effects**: PS1-style sprite-based particles for dust and fire effects
- [ ] **Expanded Audio Library**: Additional ambient sounds and music
- [ ] **Advanced Shading**: Custom PS1-style vertex lighting and texture effects
- [ ] **Interactive Objects**: Basic interaction system for switches and doors
